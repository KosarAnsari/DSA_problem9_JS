Recursion in JavaScript

üìå Overview

This project demonstrates the concept of Recursion in JavaScript. A recursive function is a function that calls itself until a specific condition (base case) is met. This approach is widely used in algorithms like factorial, Fibonacci, and tree traversals.

‚úÖ Key Concepts

Recursive Function: A function that calls itself.

Base Case: A condition that stops the recursion to avoid infinite loops.

Call Stack: A stack structure that stores function calls during recursion.



---

üß© Problem Description

Create a recursive function that prints a message "Recursion function" multiple times until a specified limit is reached.


---

üíª Code Implementation

let counter = 1;

function Rec(number) {
    if (counter > number) {
        return; // Base case to stop recursion
    }
    console.log("Recursion function");
    counter++;
    Rec(number); // Recursive call
}

Rec(10); // Calling the function with limit 10


---

‚ñ∂Ô∏è How It Works

1. The function Rec(number) is called with a given number (e.g., 10).


2. It prints "Recursion function" and increments counter.


3. The function calls itself until counter > number.


4. Once the condition is met, recursion stops.

‚úÖ Why Recursion?

Simplifies code for problems that can be divided into subproblems.

Useful in divide and conquer algorithms and data structures like trees and graphs.
